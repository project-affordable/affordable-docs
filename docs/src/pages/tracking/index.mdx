## Overview and status of loan liabilities

After the signing of a real estate contract, the bank transmits the interest and
repayment schedule. The bank then collects the interest and repayment amount
from the borrower's account within the agreed period. The customer recognises a
debit of the interest and redemption amount to his account.

If the customer has another loan with the same or a different credit
institution, the respective liabilities shall be settled via the agreed
transaction channel.

> Over the term of the loan, the customer increasingly loses track of the status
> of the loan agreement (repayments made and outstanding amounts).
