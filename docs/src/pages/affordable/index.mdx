## Existing obligations reduce personal expenses

1. Distant relationship to money, it is there but don`t know how much it is,
   hopefully enough

2) Truly required
3) Optional required
4) Luxury

What we mean by that is not if you want to buy something and you are shure you
can afford that you have to think about if you can afford.

It is more for situtaions in which you have already some obligations, a futher
might make you bannkruccy.

We don`t even mean that. When you consume maybe you reach the tipping point when
you say when I buy that I really have to look at further expences.

This is what we are trying to help with, in easy situations but live is more
than just easy descisions.

Often people tend to do bad descisions because of surringing effects.
